# Week 3 article
## A note about GitHub: I have no idea why using asterisks doesn't italicize or bold the words here. What am I missing?

Biber, D. (2009). A corpus-driven approach to formulaic language in English: Multi-word patterns in speech and writing. *International Journal of Corpus Linguistics, 14*(3), 275-311. doi: 10.1075/ijcl.14.3.98bib

## Findings
Modality matters: multi-word formulaic sequences used in spoken English differ from those used in academic writing.
Conversation patterns: fixed sequences of function and content words
Academic writing patterns: formulaic frames - function words are invariable, variable slot filled by content words intervenes

**multi-word sequences**: three or more words

Type of multi-word sequences:
- idiomatic (e.g. from the article [p. 275], "in a nutshell")
- non-idiomatic, perceptually salient (e.g. from the article [p. 276]: "you're never going to believe this")

**corpus-based** (i.e., influenced by theoretical assumptions) 

**corpus-driven** research (bottom up emergence of linguistic features from the corpus; only assumption: words exist)
- probabilistic statistics (e.g. Mutual Information Score)
- simple frequency

multi-word lexical collocations: multi-word technical terms -> sequence of lexical words
multi-word formulaic sequences: high frequency sequences of function and content words

Study: corpus-driven, incorporates a register perspective (and what Biber calls register, I would argue is a modality or mode - spoken vs. written language)
1) most frequent set of multi-word sequences
2) describe variable properties
- is the slot in the sequenced fixed or variable?

Article discussed strict corpus driven approach (p. 281)
analyze
- actual word forms only
- not consider grammatical/syntactic status of these words
- frequency of how these word forms combine
