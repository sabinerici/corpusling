Biber, D. (2009). A corpus-driven approach to formulaic language in English: Multi-word patterns in speech and writing. *International Journal of Corpus Linguistics, 14*(3), 275-311. doi: 10.1075/ijcl.14.3.98bib

## Findings
Modality matters: multi-word formulaic sequences used in spoken English differ from those used in academic writing.
Conversation patterns: fixed sequences of function and content words
Academic writing patterns: formulaic frames - function words are invariable, variable slot filled by content words intervenes

Type of multi-word sequences:
- idiomatic (e.g. from the article [p. 275], "in a nutshell")
- non-idiomatic, perceptually salient (e.g. from the article [p. 276]: "you're never going to believe this")

Difference between **corpus-based** and **corpus-driven** research
