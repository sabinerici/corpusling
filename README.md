# Reflections and Notes on the Corpus Linguistics Working Group (Wi2021)

A reminder of all the cool things I have learned from Dr. Kristopher Kyle and the Linguistics graduate students at the University of Oregon who are participating in his working group

## Week 1: Create a GitHub account
### Instructions from Kris
1. Sign up for a GitHub account
2. Create a sample repository
3. Take a look at the [markdown guidelines](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and [cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) 

### GitHub Account Creation 
- Go to [GitHub.com](github.com) and create an account. It will ask you for a username, email address and password. You'll be prompted to verify your account. Set your permissions to public.
### Sample Repository Creation
- I called mine corpusling. GitHub automatically created a readme.md file

## Week 2: Add content to the Readme file on your GitHub repository
### Instructions from Kris: 
- This should minimally include two header levels, some basic text, and at least one link. 
1. Go to settings > GitHub Pages > Choose a Jekyll theme to create the webpage. 
2. Make sure the branch is main, then your read me will be your homepage and it will create a url for you.

Besides following the instructions above, here are some more detailed instructions on how I completed the tasks:
Go to settings > GitHub Pages > Source > Select Branch: main > folder /root >Save 

#### Choosing a Jekyll Theme
Theme Chooser > Click on "Choose a theme" > Choose a Jekyll theme you want to create the webpage, then click "Select theme"

For more information on how to choose a Jekyll theme, go to this [website](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser)
#### Adding content to the Readme file
Go into the readme file where it says, "<> Edit file" and add the text for weeks 1 and 2. 
I noticed at the bottom of this page, there is a button that says "Commit Changes." My guess is this saves the file and also keeps track of changes made over time. Awesome! 







# Below is the rest of the readme file that GitHub automatically provided. 
Note to self: I am not sure how to use the "editor on GitHub" mentioned below.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sabinerici/corpusling/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sabinerici/corpusling/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
